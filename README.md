## Installation Instructions

Upload <em>main.py</em> and the directory <em>pomotuftyclasses</em> to your Tufty 2040.

## Remarks

 * I'm not used to program in Python.
 * I tried to implement the model-view-controller pattern
 * I could not figure out how the interrupts work
 * Feel free to fork and improve!
